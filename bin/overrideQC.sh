###########################################################################
#
#  Purpose:
#
#      This script is a wrapper around the process that does QC
#      checks for the uniprot load curator overrides
#
#  Usage:
#
#      overrideQC.sh  filename  
#
#      where
#          filename = full path to the input file
#
#  Env Vars:
#
#      See the configuration file
#
#  Inputs:
#	Override input file
#
#  Outputs:
#
#      - QC report for the input file.
#
#      - Log file (${QC_LOGFILE})
#
#  Exit Codes:
#
#      0:  Successful completion
#      1:  Fatal initialization error occurred
#
#  Assumes:  Nothing
#
#  Implementation:
#
#      This script will perform following steps:
#
#      1) Validate the arguments to the script.
#      2) Validate & source the configuration files to establish the environment
#      3) Verify that the input file exists.
#      4) Initialize the log and report files.
#      5) Call overrideQC.py to generate the QC report.
#
#  Notes:  None
